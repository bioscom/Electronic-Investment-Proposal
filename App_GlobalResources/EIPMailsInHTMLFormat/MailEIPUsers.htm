        <br/><br/>
        Dear Sir/Ma,<br/><br/>
        You have just been defined on Corporate Planning's electronic IP (e-IP) System to support/approve IPs. <br/>
        However, before IPs can be forwarded to your inbox, you would need to formally accept this role <br/>
        by agreeing to abide by the IP behavioural guidelines.<br/><br/>
        To do this, please click <a href=@@URL?UserName=@@USERNAME> here </a><br/><br/>
        Please note that your decision to accept or not to accept may be communicated (where deemed necessary) <br/>
        to the BPO and GM Regional Planning who maintains the list of IP signatories.<br/><br/>
        <div>
            In case of any difficulty please contact @SSSADMIN or @@SSADMN <br/>
            on ext. @@EXT or @@EMAIL
        </div>
